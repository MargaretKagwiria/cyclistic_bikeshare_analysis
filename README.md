# Cyclistic Bikeshare Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and findings from an analysis of Cyclistic's bikeshare data using R and Tableau.

## Overview

The project explores the Cyclistic bikeshare dataset to uncover insights and trends in user behavior, ride patterns, and user demographics. The analysis aims to assist Cyclistic in making data-driven decisions to improve their services and marketing strategies.

## Files
- 
- `data_cleaning_manipulation.R`: R script containing the joining of the monthly data into one csv file, data cleaning, geographic analysis, and visualization procedures.
- `season_data_map_visualization.R`: R script that groups the data into seasons for easier geographic visualization on R
- `dataset.zip`: Raw monthly csv files used for the analysis.
- `combined_raw_dataset.csv`: Combined dataset for 2022 from the monthly csv files.
- `manipulated_dataset.csv`: combined_raw_dataset.csv that has been cleaned and manipulated using R.
- `Cyclistic Bikeshare Analysis Project.twbx`: Contains the visualisations and the findings of the data analysis. The Tableau workbook is too big to post here. You can view the visualizations and findings on this link https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/margaret.kagwiria/viz/CyclisticBikeshareAnalysisProject/CyclisticBikeshareAnalysis

## Analysis Process

1. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing steps to handle missing values, format data, and prepare it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Utilizing R packages for statistical analysis, visualizations, and identifying patterns.
3. **Insights and Recommendations:** Summarizing key findings and suggesting actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Usage

To replicate or extend the analysis:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `ata_cleaning_manipulation.R` and `season_data_map_visualization.R` in your preferred R environment (e.g., RStudio).
3. Ensure the required R packages are installed.
4. Run the script sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Dependencies

The analysis was conducted using RStudio (version 2023.06.0+421) and relied on several R packages, including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`. Please refer to the script for the complete list of dependencies.

## Results

The main findings of the analysis are outlined in the T ``.
